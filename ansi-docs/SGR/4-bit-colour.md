# 4-bit Colour
These are probably the most used ANSI escape codes, used for basic colouring and are often customized by the user.

They fit in the following SGR ranges:
30-37: Foreground regular
40-47: Background regular
90-97: Foreground bright
100-107: Background bright
Put together, an example would look like `ESC[31m`

They are in the following order: red, green, yellow, blue, purple and cyan.
They are ordered in what was considered most common to show up; red was first for errors, green for successes, yellow for warnings, and blue, purple and cyan all for assorted other reasons.
