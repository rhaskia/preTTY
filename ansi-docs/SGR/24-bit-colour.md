# 24-bit Colour, AKA Full Colour
Commonly used in editors such as Vim or Emacs, these allow the terminal to render text in any colour that most modern screens support.

24-bit colour works with the following code, where r,g,b are numbers between 0-255.
`ESC[38;2;{r};{g};{b}m`

24-bit colour is newer than the 3-4 and 8 bit colour systems but has definitely been around for a while, appearing in 1993 with the release of ITU T416.
