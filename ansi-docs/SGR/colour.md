# SGR Colour Codes
This section includes the following parts:
[24 bit (full colour)](./24-bit-colour.md)
[8 bit (255 colours)](./8-bit-colour.md)
[4 bit (8/16 colour palettes)](./24-bit-colour.md)

# Other Colour Codes
There are also a handful of other ANSI codes that can be used to change colours, but most are lesser supported, and often times are rebrands of existing commands and should not be considered.
